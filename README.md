Description: 
    web app to connect non-profit organizations with volunteers of similar interests

Brief Introduction: 
    
    The website’s goal is to connect non-profit organizations with volunteers of aligning interests. Users are able to create accounts as organizations or volunteers then tag their profiles with interests/organization description tags. The web app then recommends organizations to volunteers with aligning interests and allows volunteers to browse and search for organizations manually.
    
    Examples of volunteer and organization tags are working with children, working with elderly, foreign relief, environmentalism, etc. The web app recommends organizations to volunteers on their homepage and notifies organizations of interested volunteers.


To Run:
    
    Step 1. Install packages
        CD into project directory
        Run 'npm install'
        This installs all required dependencies
    
    Step 2. Seed database
        While in project directory,
        Run 'npm run seed' or 'npm seed'
        This seeds the database with accounts, organizations, comments, and reviews for viewing purposes. These may not all be real organizations.
    
    Step 3. Start Server
        While in project directory,
        Run 'npm start'
        This starts the webapp server and outputs to the terminal a message showing the local host the server is running from.
    
To Test:
    
    On a web browser,
    go to 'http://localhost:3000/'
    This will take you to the landing page of Volunteer Finder.
